# sort numbers and letters

## Objectives

1. Write an implementation of an alphanumeric sort.sort. In this case, we should sort numbers first,
followed by lowercase letters, uppercase letters and then all other characters. The special case
here is that if any two numerical characters are next to each other
2. Write the smallest possible test case in Rspec that matches what validates the input is valid
## Instructions

To use this program close this repository using the link provided in the code drop down: https://github.com/acantu101/sorting.git
Make sure Ruby is installed in the terminal
Run the Rspec test with 
```
ruby sorter.rb 
```
You should see the test pass where we pass ```'A411a4'``` as input in the sorting method at ```sorting.rb``` and expect ```"411aA"``` as output.

The ```sorting.rb``` file contains the method for sorting. You can run the file ```ruby sorting.rb``` and then run 
```ruby
sorting("your input here")
#=> your output
```
